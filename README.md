Check Python Installation: Confirm that Python is installed correctly on your system. You can do this by opening a command prompt and typing python --version. If Python is installed, it will display the version number.
Add Python to PATH: If Python is installed, but pip is not recognized, you'll need to add Python to your system's PATH environment variable manually. During the Python installation process, there is an option to add Python to PATH. However, if you missed this option, you can still add Python to PATH manually.
Find the directory where Python is installed on your system. This is typically C:\PythonXX (where XX represents the version number).
Open the Control Panel and go to System and Security > System > Advanced system settings.
Click on the "Environment Variables" button.
In the "System Variables" section, find the Path variable and select it. Click "Edit".
Add the path to your Python installation directory to the list of paths. For example, if Python is installed in C:\Python39, add C:\Python39 to the list.
Click "OK" to save the changes.
Verify Installation: Close and reopen the command prompt, then try typing python --version and pip --version again to verify that both Python and pip are recognized.
